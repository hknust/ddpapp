## Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from the [Bureau of Economic Analysis ](http://www.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm) site. Select the NAICS All GDP Components option of the  GDP by State drop-down. The data was filtered to just the GDP data for each state by major industry group to reduce the overall size.

## Usage
Select the desired year from the Year drop-down. After a selection is made, the aggregated GDP data for the selected industries is computed and the map automatically updated.
